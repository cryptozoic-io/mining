The community now decides to make the following changes to super nodes:

1. From block 554,240 to 1,920,000, add 12 super node quotas per block week.
2. From block 1,920,001 to 3,840,000, add 6 quotas per block week. Until the block height is 3,840,000, stop increasing the quota.
3. After the upper limit of the quota is increased, the nodes in the queue automatically fill the valid nodes.
